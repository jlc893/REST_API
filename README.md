# Git Commands REST API

I've recently started using GIT and have found it difficult to remember all the commands. I've created this API to store the commands that we often forget. This API stores an id of the command, the name, and a description of what it is used for.

## Technologies / Concepts used:
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy 
- REST API Practices
- HTTP Methods (CRUD, status codes)
- Tested with Postman and SwaggerUI
- Deployed with Docker
